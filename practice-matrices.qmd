# Practice 2: Matrices and lists

## Answer the following questions using R

1.  Create 2 vectors A and B, where A is $(1, 2, 3)$ and B is $(4, 5, 6)$. With these vectors, use the `cbind()` or `rbind()` function to create a 2 by 3 matrix from the vectors. You'll need to figure out which of these binding functions is the correct choice.
2.  Create a 3 by 3 matrix consisting of the numbers 1 to 9. Create this matrix using the shortcut `1:9` and by specifying the `nrow` argument in the `matrix()` function call. Assign this matrix to the variable `mat`.
3.  Confirm that `mat` is a matrix using `is.matrix()`.
4.  Create a 5 by 5 matrix consisting of the numbers 1 to 25 and assign it to the variable `mat2`. The top row should be the numbers 1 to 5.
5.  Using indexing notation, grab a sub-matrix of `mat2` from question 4 that looks like this: $$ \begin{pmatrix}  7 & 8 \cr 12 & 13 \end{pmatrix} $$
6.  Using indexing notation, grab a sub-section of `mat2` from question 4 that looks like this: $$ \begin{pmatrix}  19 & 20 \cr 24 & 25 \end{pmatrix} $$
7.  What is the sum of all the elements in `mat2`?
8.  Use `runif()` to create a 4 by 5 matrix consisting of 20 random numbers.

    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to the public repository of the enhancement class on R for Data Science offered at The Bedford Sixth Form. In this page you will find the list of all data set that are going to be used in the course, as well as useful information, and a brief note of all the topics covered in each lesson.\n\nAim of this course\nThe aim of this course is to give a thorough and opinionated introduction to R using the magnificent IDE RStudio, to show how the program excellently performs data analysis on different data sets, to introduce to the use of the meta-package tidyverse to perform exploratory data analysis, clean and reshape the data, and to give an introduction to machine learning algorithms using the meta-package tidymodels.\nIn the second part of the course, when the students have acquired the basic syntax of R, the course will move onto an individual project in which every participant can collect suitable data and analyse the data to answer a statistical question on a topic of their choice, and write a full reproducible report to show their findings. The project may be published on RPubs and can be included in the student’s portfolio, to show potential employers or to university their ability to use the software and to analyse data.\n\n\nPrerequisites to follow this course\nThis course has basically no prerequisites, except the notions of mathematics and statistics from any GCSE Mathematics course. In particular, the learner is assumed to know the following statistical tools: mean, mode, median, range, interquartile range, box-and-whiskers plot, histogram, bar chart. Any other statistical instrument that might be useful will be briefly recalled during the course.\n\n\nInstall R and RStudio\n\nTo install R, it suffices to follow the link to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository and to install R clicking on the Download R for &lt;your-base-system&gt;.\n\nIn this course we will also assume that you have installed the RStudio IDE. This open-source, integrated desktop environment makes it possible for all R users to have a common R interface, which is greatly enhanced over the R’s basic command line interface.\n\nInstallation of RStudio is straightforward in most cases. The RStudio web site has links to the necessary files to download.\n\n\n\nBibliography\nI am adding below some websites that you might find useful to look for data.\n\nThe UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI Repository) contains lots of data sets that can be used to do machine learning.\nTidyTuesday is a project of the R community that aims to provide weekly real world data sets to tidy and analyse.\nKaggle is a great place to find little useful challenges to do. We shall see some of these challenges in our course, but you may always want to attempt one of them of your own. If there is a general consensus on a particular challenge, that could also be done as a team.\nThe World Bank contains a wealth of data that can be analysed.\n\nAlso you may wish to check the little publications that I have made on RPubs."

    "text": "There are several ways to interact with R. The primary one will be through the command line, also known as console. The command line in RStudio is in the console panel. The name comes from it being the place where one types in commands.\n\n\n\nBefore going ahead and introducing variables, it is convenient to start putting our work into an R Script. In RStudio, click File &gt; New File &gt; R Script to open a new script. Changing line in the script won’t run the code, however. In order to run the line of code you may press Ctrl + ENTER in Windows and cmd + ENTER in Mac. There are also commands to run the whole script, but let’s just keep it simple for the time being.\n\n\n\nIn first instance, R is a very powerful and fancy calculator. Typing in the command line numerical expressions with the usual mathematical operations, we get the results we expect:\n\n2 + 3\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe four operations in R are +, -, * and / and R follows the usual mathematical rules for the priority of the operations (the one that some people call BIDMAS).\n\n5 * 2 - 12 / 4\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nThe order of the operations can be altered using brackets, like so:\n\n(4 + 5 * 2) / (8 / 2 - 3)\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nBesides the four operations, R has some very useful other operations, such as the integer division %/% and the modulo %% of two numbers. The integer division gives the quotient of the division and the modulo gives the remainder of the division, like so:\n\n25 %/% 4\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n25 %% 4\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nIn fact, we have 25 = 6 x 4 + 1.\nWe can also perform powers with R. The syntax is a ^ n to produce a to the power of n. For example,\n\n3 ^ 4\n\n[1] 81\n\n\n\n\nR is also equipped with two special “values” that represent “true” and “false”. These are called the Boolean values and denoted in R by TRUE or T, and FALSE or F. These two special values can be joined together through the logical operations which are: and, or, and not. In R, and is represented by &, or by | and not by !. So, for example, we have:\n\nTRUE & FALSE\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nTRUE | FALSE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n!FALSE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAgain, logical values can be linked together with brackets.\n\n\n\n\nOnce started understanding how R works with operations and numbers, we wish to start assigning values to variables and working with variables instead. R provides a special command to assign a value to a variable: &lt;-. This is called the assignment operator. For example\n\nx &lt;- 10\ny &lt;- 2.5\n\nx * y\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nYou don’t have to use a single letter to name a variable. Conversely, it is advisable not to do so, but to use meaningful words that recall the meaning of that variable. For example, to record the height and weight of an individual, we could use\n\nheight &lt;- 150\nweight &lt;- 65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the names of variables\n\n\n\nA variable name must start with a letter, but it can contain also numbers, full stop, and underscore after the first letter. There are several different schools of thought about which is the best way to denote variables. In the past, I would have probably chosen a notation such as my.variable to indicate a variable, but after having coded for a long time alongside the magnificent data scientists and software engineers at Posit (former RStudio), I am now more used to a notation like my_variable which I do recommend.\n\n\nWe can work with variables joining them together with the usual operations. For example:\n\nbank_account &lt;- 100\ndeposit &lt;-  30\n\nbank_account &lt;- bank_account + deposit\n\nbank_account\n\n[1] 130\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike programming languages such as C, Pascal, etc, R doesn’t require to state in advance the type of the variables but it assigns the data type automatically. In most simple cases, the user doesn’t really need bother about the data types, but in some cases, and especially when one starts working with data frames and working in machine learning, awareness of the variable type is very important, and the ability to change data type is paramount.\nR has many different data types. In what follows we shall go through the most important of them.\n\n\nThe most common data type is double, i.e. decimal numbers described using floating point values. Any number is stored in R as a double, unless otherwise specified. So, for example, the following are double.\n\na &lt;- 5\nb &lt;- 2.2\n\nTo see the type of these variable, we can use the command typeof. So\n\ntypeof(a)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(b)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo tell R that we want the number to be an integer we need to add an L after the number during the assignment. For example\n\nn &lt;- 5L\n\nis an integer. To see this, let’s use again the typeof command:\n\ntypeof(n)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nDouble and integer are referred to as numeric variables.\n\n\n\nR has also the possibility to store complex numbers. This is done using the key i for the imaginary unit. For example:\n\nz &lt;- 2 + 3i\nw &lt;- 5 + 2i\n\nIf variables are complex, R knows how to adapt the arithmetic operations to complex numbers. For example,\n\nz + w\n\n[1] 7+5i\n\n2 * z\n\n[1] 4+6i\n\n(1 - 2i) * w\n\n[1] 9-8i\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have mentioned before, R has two Boolean values (true and false). Their type is logical.\n\np &lt;- TRUE\ntypeof(p)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother common type is character, which is the data type of characters and strings. To assign a character type to a variable, we use the quotation marks: both the single ' and the double \" quotation marks work.\n\nchar &lt;- \"Hello, world!\"\ntypeof(char)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBeside typeof, there is another command that shows the type of a variable: class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R we can use comparison operators to compare variables and return a logical value. The comparison operators are\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\n==\nequal\na == b\n\n\n!=\ndifferent\na != b\n\n\n&lt;=\nsmaller than, or equal to\na &lt;= b\n\n\n&lt;\nsmaller than\na &lt; b\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than, or equal to\na &gt;= b\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\na &gt; b\n\n\n\nFor example,\n\n5 &gt; 3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n6 &lt; 3\n\n[1] FALSE"

E.g.\n\nmean(ages)\n\n[1] 35.55556\n\n\nOther statistical operations are median to calculate the median, IQR to find the interquartile range, sd to find the standard deviation and summary to show a five number summary of the variable, i.e. the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum in the vector. The function summary also shows the mean.\n\nsummary(ages)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

    "text": "R is a statistical software and in statistics a variable scarcely has only one value, but it is generally given as a list of values (measurements). For example, one could have a variable age of the ages of all the employees of a small business. To store this in R, we can use the function c() which stands for concatenate. To use this function, we pass the values of the vector as a list, separated by a comma. For example\n\nages &lt;- c(25, 33, 45, 37, 28, 23, 42, 58, 29)\nages\n\n[1] 25 33 45 37 28 23 42 58 29\n\n\nNow the variable age is a vector. Let’s find out the length of this vector.\n\nlength(ages)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\n\nWe can create vectors with any data type. For example,\n\nnvec &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ntypeof(nvec)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ncvec &lt;- c(\"G\", \"C\", \"S\", \"E\")\ntypeof(cvec)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nlvec &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)\ntypeof(lvec)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nIt is important to note now that all the elements of a vector must all have the same type. In fact, if we attempt to mix data types in a vector, R will convert them to force them to have all the same data type. For example,\n\nv &lt;- c(FALSE, 3, TRUE, 6)\ntypeof(v)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nIn fact, R will convert TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0.\n\nw &lt;- c(\"A\", 1)\ntypeof(w)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIn this case, as we could imagine, R converts everything to be a character.\n\nw\n\n[1] \"A\" \"1\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interesting feature of R is that each element in a vector can be named. Precisely, we can use the function name() to assign to each element of a vector a name. For example, imagine the following vector contains a week of temperatures:\n\ntemp &lt;- c(18, 16, 17, 17, 18, 16, 15)\ntemp\n\n[1] 18 16 17 17 18 16 15\n\n\nWe know that we have 7 temperatures for the 7 days of the week, but which temperature corresponds to which day? Does it start from Monday or from Sunday, or another day of the week? This is where the function name() can be used to assign a label to each value of the vector temp, as follows:\n\ndays &lt;- c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\")\nnames(temp) &lt;- days\ntemp\n\nMon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun \n 18  16  17  17  18  16  15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have mentioned a couple of times already, R is a statistical software. This means that all aspects of R are centred on working with statistical data. Therefore, performing operations in R is specifically designed to make working with data as simple as possible. In particular, all arithmetic operations are vectorised, which means that the operations occur on an element by element basis. for example, take the following two vectors:\n\nvec_1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nvec_2 &lt;- c(5, 6, 7)\n\nAdding vectors:\n\nvec_1 + vec_2\n\n[1]  6  8 10\n\n\nSubtracting vectors:\n\nvec_1 - vec_2\n\n[1] -4 -4 -4"
